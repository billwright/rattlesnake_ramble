<h2>Rattlesnake Ramble Odd-Year Course</h2>

<p>This is a description of the Rattlesnake Ramble course for the odd years, meaning this is the course in 2025, 2027, etc.
  The race starts at the west end of the lower parking lot and runs up the main road through the canyon to the Fowler
  Trail.
  Here the race takes a 180-degree turn and follows the Fowler trail back to the east until racers hit the eastern
  border of the park. There they turn around and run back to the road. Once there, racers continue west on the road to
  nearly the western boundary of the park before turning up the Eldorado Trail. The course follows this trail to the
  park boundary and then turns around and runs back down to the road. Once on the main road, head east and downhill back
  to the start/finish.
  This course is 4.25 miles long and has 800 of
  climbing.
