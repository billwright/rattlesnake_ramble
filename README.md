# README

This is the repository for the Rattlesnake Ramble website, hosted at https://www.rattlesnakeramble.org.

Local setup requires the following:

* Ruby version: 3.2.5
* Rails version: 6.1
* Postgres 11 (16 is the latest version)

The actual versions used in this project can be seen in the Gemfile
and the .ruby-version file.

This project uses rbenv to manage Ruby versions. If you don't have rbenv installed, you can install it with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install rbenv
```

The version for the project is specified in the `.ruby-version` file of this project. To install the correct Ruby
version, run:

```bash
rbenv install
```

Then, make sure to initialize rbenv in your shell:

```bash
rbenv init
```

Also, put this in your `.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"
```

## Database creation

- Install Postgres if you don't have it already:

##### Using Homebrew on MacOS

> `$ brew install postgresql@16`

Follow the instructions for automatically starting postgres when you start your machine.

* Database initialization

> `$ bundle exec rails db:reset`

* How to run the test suite

> `$ bundle exec rspec`

## Deployment instruction

### Installing the Heroku CLI

Go [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) to install the CLI.

Once you have it installed (or to check that you have it installed), do this:

```shell
heroku --version
```

Now login:

```
heroku login
```
In order to push to heroku, you need to have added heroku as a remote repository. You can 
check if this has been added by running:

```shell
git remote show heroku
```

If it doesn't exist, add it with the heroku CLI:

```shell
heroku git:remote -a rattlesnake-ramble
```

Once your local master is up to date and you have Heroku CLI credentials in place, run the following command:

> `$ git push heroku master`

#### Useful Aliases

```bash
alias gs='git status'
alias gp='git push'
alias gpr='git push heroku master'
alias test='rake test'
alias resetdb='rake db:reset'
alias rebuilddb='rake db:schema:load'
alias start='rails server -b $IP -p $PORT'
alias pushToHeroku='git push heroku master'
```

#### Useful things

I use [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to manage my ruby versions.
To install a new version do this:

```shell
rvm install 3.0.4
```

I had trouble with rvm and then used rbenv with some luck. Until Heroku started complaining about the version of Ruby I was using (3.2.4) and
rbenv didn't even list that version (maxed at 3.2.4) and only went to 3.3.1 (Heroku supports 3.3.5), but still couldn't
install rvm, so then did:

```shell
> brew install install-ruby
```

This ran for a *long* time, but eventually installed Ruby 3.2.5.



If you need to mess with the database (not recommended, as we prefer admin pages on the site), you can
do so via the Heroku [console](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/rattlesnake-ramble?web-console=rattlesnake-ramble).
Once there you can run the Rails Console

```shell
heroku run console
```

Then you can select Active Record models, modify them, and commit them to the database like this:

```ruby
latest = RaceEdition.find_by(:date => '2022-09-10')
latest.date = Date.new(2022, 9, 17)
latest.default_start_time_female = Time.zone.parse('2022-09-17 13:52:00')
latest.save
```

## To see all the routes that this application supports, run:

```bash
rails routes
```

It shows something like this:

```bash

## Features

### Optional Merchandise (mostly shirts) Buy

Upon signing up for the race, if the 
current race edition is selling a product,
then an image of the product should be
displayed, a text description of the product
should be displayed and a dropdown should
be displayed with options the user
should be displayed ('Female Small', 'Male Medium', etc.),
and the price should be displayed.
If the product is selected, then the 
price of the product is added to the 
PayPal total and the sale is recorded
in the Sales table.

The Sales table should reference the
product, specify the option, the date
purchased, and the racer purchasing 
the product.
